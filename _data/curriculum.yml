      standard). The major duties regarded:

      * the design, implementation, and documentation of a "reverse proxy" to
        be used in eGLU-Box using [Laravel](https://laravel.com){:target="_blank"} (PHP);
      * the evaluation (and refactoring) of various components of the system.

      During this period, multiple research activities (that are leading to
      various publications: check the [publications' section](#publications)) were started.
