  abstract = {Dementia is one of the most common diseases in the elderly and a leading cause of mortality and disability. In recent years, a research effort has been made to develop computer aided diagnosis tools based on machine (deep) learning models fed with neuroimaging data. However, while much work has been done on MRI imaging, very little attention has been paid on amyloid PETs, which have been recently recognized to be a promising and powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. In this paper, we contribute to this less explored research area by proposing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network aimed at detecting dementia based on amyloid PET scans. An experiment performed on the recently released OASIS-3 dataset, which provides the community with a new benchmark to advance this line of research further, yielded very promising results and provided new evidence on the effectiveness of amyloid PET.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning and imaging technologies have revolutionized automated medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging. Despite the availability of various imaging modalities for the same patient, the development of multi-modal models leveraging these modalities remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and evaluating classification models using 2D and 3D MRI images and amyloid PET scans in uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that models using volumetric data learn more effective representations than those using only 2D images. Furthermore, integrating multiple modalities enhances model performance over single-modality approaches significantly. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS-3 cohort. Additionally, explainability analyses with Grad-CAM indicate that our model focuses on crucial AD-related regions for its predictions, underscoring its potential to aid in understanding the disease's causes.},

  abstract = {Tumors can manifest in various forms and in different areas of the human body. Brain tumors are specifically hard to diagnose and treat because of the complexity of the organ in which they develop. Detecting them in time can lower the chances of death and facilitate the therapy process for patients. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning, has the potential to significantly reduce costs in terms of time and resources for the discovery and identification of tumors from images obtained through imaging techniques. This research work aims to assess the performance of a multimodal model for the classification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans processed as grayscale images. The results are promising, and in line with similar works, as the model reaches an accuracy of around 99\%. We also highlight the need for explainability and transparency to ensure human control and safety.},

While the actual manufacturing process is largely automated today, users still require knowledge of complex design applications to produce ready-designed objects and adapt them to their needs or design new objects from scratch. To lower the barrier to the design and customization of personalized 3D models, we explored novice mental models in voice-based 3D modeling by conducting a high-fidelity Wizard of Oz study with 22 participants. We performed a thematic analysis of the collected data to understand how the mental model of novices translates into voice-based 3D modeling. We conclude with design implications for voice assistants. For example, they have to: deal with vague, incomplete and wrong commands; provide a set of straightforward commands to shape simple and composite objects; and offer different strategies to select 3D objects.},

However, users may need to create intelligent solutions tailored to their specific needs. In this way, AI systems can be enhanced if new approaches are devised to allow non-technical users to be directly involved in the definition and personalization of AI technologies. End-User Development (EUD) can provide a solution to these problems, allowing people to create, customize, or adapt AI-based systems to their own needs. This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to shed the light on the current landscape of EUD for AI systems, i.e., how users, even without skills in AI and/or programming, can customize the AI behavior to their needs. This study also discusses the current challenges of EUD for AI, the potential benefits, and the future implications of integrating EUD into the overall AI development process.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming widespread in all aspects of society, bringing benefits to the whole economy. There is a growing understanding of the potential benefits and risks of this type of technology. While the benefits are more efficient decision processes and industrial productivity, the risks may include a potential progressive disengagement of human beings in crucial aspects of decision-making. In this respect, a new perspective is emerging that aims at reconsidering the centrality of human beings while reaping the benefits of AI systems to augment rather than replace professional skills: Human-Centred AI (HCAI) is a novel framework that posits that high levels of human control do not contradict high levels of computer automation. In this paper, we investigate the two antipodes, automation vs augmentation, in the context of website usability evaluation. Specifically, we have analyzed whether the level of automation provided by a tool for semi-automatic usability evaluation can support evaluators in identifying usability problems. Three different visualizations, each one corresponding to a different level of automation, ranging from a full-automation approach to an augmentation approach, were compared in an experimental study. We found that a fully automated approach could help evaluators detect a significant number of medium and high-severity usability problems, which are the most critical in a software system; however, it also emerged that it was possible to detect more low-severity usability problems using one of the augmented approaches proposed in this paper.},

AI solutions are already being used to detect phishing emails, but they typically do not address the problem of explaining to users why certain emails are considered dangerous.

This paper presents an XAI-based solution to classify phishing emails and alert users to the risk by explaining the reasons behind the attacks. We compared different ML models using a subset of features that can be explained and understood by non-IT users. We found that Explainable Boosting Machine was the best choice for a high-performance and interpretable classifier for email phishing detection.},

This is also the case with phishing emails: when a defense system detects a suspicious message, users are typically presented with warning dialogs that inform them of the risks. However, warnings are often designed without adequate consideration of the end user, leading to incorrect decisions that lower the benefit of the AI models. To overcome the limitations identified in the literature, this paper presents an XAI phishing detection system built following a human-centered design approach. It classifies phishing emails and generates polymorphic warning dialogs that explain to the user why the email might be a scam, with the ultimate goal of supporting a more informed decision on whether or not to open suspicious content.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) offer numerous benefits, but they also pose threats, such as cybercriminals creating fake, convincing content such as phishing emails. LLMs are more convenient for criminals than handcrafting, making phishing campaigns more likely and more widespread in the future. To combat these attacks, detecting whether an email is generated by LLMs is critical. However, previous attempts have resulted in solutions that are uninterpretable and resource-intensive due to their complexity. This results in warning dialogs that do not adequately protect users. This work aims to address this problem using traditional, lightweight machine learning models that are easy to interpret and require fewer computational resources. This approach allows users to understand why an email is AI-generated, improving their decision-making in the case of phishing emails. This study has shown that logistic regression can achieve excellent performance in detecting emails generated by LLMs, while still providing the transparency needed to provide useful explanations to users.},
