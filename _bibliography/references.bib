  abstract	= {The workshop ``Augmented Artificial Intelligence: a
		  Symbiotic Approach to enhance Decision-Making'' (A2ID) aims
		  to explore the human-AI collaboration in contexts in which
		  the decision-making process can be supported and augmented,
		  emphasizing a human-centered approach to design and develop
		  Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and fostering human-AI
		  symbiosis. The goal is to create systems that work
		  symbiotically with humans by employing Human-Computer
		  Interaction (HCI)'s guidelines and best practices in
		  designing and developing AI systems. Symbiotic Artificial
		  Intelligence (SAI), which is a specialization of
		  Human-Centered AI (HCAI), aims to achieve this objective by
		  supporting humans rather than replacing them, while
		  enhancing their skills. AI can represent a great resource.
		  However, challenges such as biases in training data,
		  over-reliance on AI, and lack of interpretability still
		  persist, raising concerns about trust, fairness, and
		  ethical compliance of AI systems. This workshop addresses
		  these issues by promoting the same multidisciplinary
		  perspective that characterizes the creation of SAI systems,
		  integrating HCI, AI, Ethics and Laws, Software Engineering
		  (SE) and End-User Development (EUD). Through discussions
		  and knowledge exchange, participants will investigate the
		  components of human-AI interaction that characterize the
		  symbiotic relationship between the two parties in
		  decision-making scenarios (for example, in the medical
		  domain).},

  abstract	= {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming
		  widespread in all aspects of society, bringing benefits to
		  the whole economy. There is a growing understanding of the
		  potential benefits and risks of this type of technology.
		  While the benefits are more efficient decision processes
		  and industrial productivity, the risks may include a
		  potential progressive disengagement of human beings in
		  crucial aspects of decision-making. In this respect, a new
		  perspective is emerging that aims at reconsidering the
		  centrality of human beings while reaping the benefits of AI
		  systems to augment rather than replace professional skills:
		  Human-Centred AI (HCAI) is a novel framework that posits
		  that high levels of human control do not contradict high
		  levels of computer automation. In this paper, we
		  investigate the two antipodes, automation vs augmentation,
		  in the context of website usability evaluation.
		  Specifically, we have analyzed whether the level of
		  automation provided by a tool for semi-automatic usability
		  evaluation can support evaluators in identifying usability
		  problems. Three different visualizations, each one
		  corresponding to a different level of automation, ranging
		  from a full-automation approach to an augmentation
		  approach, were compared in an experimental study. We found
		  that a fully automated approach could help evaluators
		  detect a significant number of medium and high-severity
		  usability problems, which are the most critical in a
		  software system; however, it also emerged that it was
		  possible to detect more low-severity usability problems
		  using one of the augmented approaches proposed in this
		  paper.},
