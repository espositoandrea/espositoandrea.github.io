  abstract = {Dementia is one of the most common diseases in the elderly and a leading cause of mortality and disability. In recent years, a research effort has been made to develop computer aided diagnosis tools based on machine (deep) learning models fed with neuroimaging data. However, while much work has been done on MRI imaging, very little attention has been paid on amyloid PETs, which have been recently recognized to be a promising and powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. In this paper, we contribute to this less explored research area by proposing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network aimed at detecting dementia based on amyloid PET scans. An experiment performed on the recently released OASIS-3 dataset, which provides the community with a new benchmark to advance this line of research further, yielded very promising results and provided new evidence on the effectiveness of amyloid PET.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning and imaging technologies have revolutionized automated medical image analysis, especially in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease through neuroimaging. Despite the availability of various imaging modalities for the same patient, the development of multi-modal models leveraging these modalities remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and evaluating classification models using 2D and 3D MRI images and amyloid PET scans in uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks. Our findings demonstrate that models using volumetric data learn more effective representations than those using only 2D images. Furthermore, integrating multiple modalities enhances model performance over single-modality approaches significantly. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS-3 cohort. Additionally, explainability analyses with Grad-CAM indicate that our model focuses on crucial AD-related regions for its predictions, underscoring its potential to aid in understanding the disease's causes.},

  abstract = {Tumors can manifest in various forms and in different areas of the human body. Brain tumors are specifically hard to diagnose and treat because of the complexity of the organ in which they develop. Detecting them in time can lower the chances of death and facilitate the therapy process for patients. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning, has the potential to significantly reduce costs in terms of time and resources for the discovery and identification of tumors from images obtained through imaging techniques. This research work aims to assess the performance of a multimodal model for the classification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans processed as grayscale images. The results are promising, and in line with similar works, as the model reaches an accuracy of around 99\%. We also highlight the need for explainability and transparency to ensure human control and safety.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has become more and more relevant in our society. Creating AI systems is almost always the prerogative of IT and AI experts. However, users may need to create intelligent solutions tailored to their specific needs. In this way, AI systems can be enhanced if new approaches are devised to allow non-technical users to be directly involved in the definition and personalization of AI technologies. End-User Development (EUD) can provide a solution to these problems, allowing people to create, customize, or adapt AI-based systems to their own needs. This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to shed the light on the current landscape of EUD for AI systems, i.e., how users, even without skills in AI and/or programming, can customize the AI behavior to their needs. This study also discusses the current challenges of EUD for AI, the potential benefits, and the future implications of integrating EUD into the overall AI development process.},

AI solutions are already being used to detect phishing emails, but they typically do not address the problem of explaining to users why certain emails are considered dangerous. This leads to users not understanding the risk and/or not trusting the defense system, resulting in higher success rates of phishing attacks. This paper presents an XAI-based solution to classify phishing emails and alert users to the risk by explaining the reasons behind the attacks. We compared different ML models using a subset of features that can be explained and understood by non-IT users. We found that Explainable Boosting Machine was the best choice for a high-performance and interpretable classifier for email phishing detection.},

This is also the case with phishing emails: when a defense system detects a suspicious message, users are typically presented with warning dialogs that inform them of the risks. However, warnings are often designed without adequate consideration of the end user, leading to incorrect decisions that lower the benefit of the AI models. To overcome the limitations identified in the literature, this paper presents an XAI phishing detection system built following a human-centered design approach. It classifies phishing emails and generates polymorphic warning dialogs that explain to the user why the email might be a scam, with the ultimate goal of supporting a more informed decision on whether or not to open suspicious content.},
