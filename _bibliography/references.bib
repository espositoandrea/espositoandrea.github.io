  abstract = {AI models are widely used in cybersecurity to identify digital content that could be malicious. This is also the case with phishing emails: when a defense system detects a suspicious message, users are typically presented with warning dialogs that inform them of the risks. However, warnings are often designed without adequate consideration of the end user, leading to incorrect decisions that lower the benefit of the AI models. To overcome the limitations identified in the literature, this paper presents an XAI phishing detection system built following a human-centered design approach. It classifies phishing emails and generates polymorphic warning dialogs that explain to the user why the email might be a scam, with the ultimate goal of supporting a more informed decision on whether or not to open suspicious content.},

  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09863},
  abstract = {In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has become more and more relevant in our society. Creating AI systems is almost always the prerogative of IT and AI experts. However, users may need to create intelligent solutions tailored to their specific needs. In this way, AI systems can be enhanced if new approaches are devised to allow non-technical users to be directly involved in the definition and personalization of AI technologies. End-User Development (EUD) can provide a solution to these problems, allowing people to create, customize, or adapt AI-based systems to their own needs. This paper presents a systematic literature review that aims to shed the light on the current landscape of EUD for AI systems, i.e., how users, even without skills in AI and/or programming, can customize the AI behavior to their needs. This study also discusses the current challenges of EUD for AI, the potential benefits, and the future implications of integrating EUD into the overall AI development process.},

  abstract = {Although User eXperience (UX) is widely acknowledged as an important aspect of software products, its evaluation is often neglected during the development of most software products, primarily because developers think that it is resource-demanding and complain about the fact that is scarcely automated. Various attempts have been made to develop tools that support and automate the execution of tests with users. This paper is about an ongoing research work that exploits Machine Learning (ML) for automatic UX evaluation, specifically for understanding users' emotions by analyzing the log data of the users' interactions with websites. The approach described aims at overcoming some limitations of existing proposals based on ML.},

  venue = {Orlando, Florida, USA},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Dementia is one of the most common diseases in the elderly and a leading cause of mortality and disability. In recent years, a research effort has been made to develop computer aided diagnosis tools based on machine (deep) learning models fed with neuroimaging data. However, while much work has been done on MRI imaging, very little attention has been paid on amyloid PETs, which have been recently recognized to be a promising and powerful biomarker of neurodegeneration. In this paper, we contribute to this less explored research area by proposing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network aimed at detecting dementia based on amyloid PET scans. An experiment performed on the recently released OASIS-3 dataset, which provides the community with a new benchmark to advance this line of research further, yielded very promising results and provided new evidence on the effectiveness of amyloid PET.},
