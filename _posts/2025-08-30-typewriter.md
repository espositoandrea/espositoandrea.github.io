My mind and general interests are currently in a very hard spot. I am a
Computer Science researcher. This brings me face-to-face with technology every
day. And I do that with immense pleasure: I love keeping updated on the latest
tech news and gadgets. I usually follow, every year, at least Apple's WWDC, in
an attempt to understand where the software I use every day is moving to. And I
feel genuine excitement about any new announcement they make. As an example,
working in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, I was genuinely thrilled
when Apple introduced the "Dynamic Island" because, in a way, it was blurring
the line between hardware and software.

Every new gadget, tool, app, software, and whatnot sparks my curiosity. I
*must* try them all.

However, this sort of "maximalism" when it comes to the tools I use every day
for my work is not something that is actually useful, but rather almost
harmful.

I usually struggle with an astonishingly easy-to-distract brain. Therefore, the
sheer amount of tools is a perfectly fertile ground to get my mind out of the
zone and start trying new stuff out. Some days, I happen to not be able to do
any actual work at all, but rather I spend the entire time trying out new
stuff, or customizing (which I justify as "improving") already-known tools.

Obviously, this is a serious hazard for my productivity on its own, but the
effects are amplified by the usual digital distractions: messages, e-mails, MS
Teams calls, calendar invites, social media… A nightmare full of inputs for my
already lazy and easily distracted brain…

Now, being a researcher means that a great deal of my time is spent on writing
stuff. Whether it is a report, a paper, some documentation, bureaucratic forms,
or whatever else, I am writing. So, I need a way to improve my focus and get
myself in flow for writing.

Here enters my grandad. During a routine clean-up of his garage, he found an
old typewriter that he had: an old *Olivetti Studio 45 i*. Before he threw it
away, I got an idea: why not try using it to reach my goal of distraction-free
in-the-zone writing?

I wouldn't be the first one using a typewriter in 2025 for the purpose of
typing drafts of text: a quick search on YouTbube or Googls surfaces enough
results to help me not feeling stupid for even having had this idea.

*Did it work?* I currently have no idea. In theory, it should: using a
typewriter lets you have absolutely no form of distractions (unless someone
comes tapping on your shoulder, clearly), and having a material piece of paper
with writing on it is a plus since it makes reviewing your text a far more
pleasurable experience (at least for me, since I prefer reading on paper).
However, I have not had this typewriter for enough time to understand whether
it has improved my workflow.

One thing is certain, though: the initial draft of this post was written on
this typewriter, and I had words flowing out of me like they never did. So, I'm
faithful, and I'll post updates with the results of my very non-scientific
test.
