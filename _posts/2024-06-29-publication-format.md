Nowadays two problems affect science.

- The *quantum* necessary to publish scientific discovery is large. This not only heavily increases the time needed for publication, but it also impacts the time required to stay up to date with the scientific literature, stifling innovation. This is a problem generally accepted and recognized: in fact, the "Journal of Brief Ideas" was created with this exact goal in mind ([Harris, 2015](https://beta.briefideas.org/ideas/17b997da912f99ce9988a47f42b52692)).
- Back when science was just starting out, scientists were used to publishing for the general public. In fact, most of the *classics* books on "science" can be read by everyone, although the general, lay reader may find some difficulties in this activity. This probably increases the chances that science is discovered, and adopted.

Would it be possible to evaluate the impact that the standards of publications have on science? If so, how? Should researchers be more "conscious" of the general public, allowing for broader access to science and potentially improving our overall culture? Should researchers be encouraged to disseminate their research to the general public? If so, how should these changes be proposed to academia?

***Disclaimer:** I got this idea while reading: ["How to Read a Book" by Adler, M. & Van Doren, C.](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Read_a_Book/Xg-CBAAAQBAJ?hl=it&gbpv=0&kptab=overview). Further research is needed to confirm the hypotheses.*
