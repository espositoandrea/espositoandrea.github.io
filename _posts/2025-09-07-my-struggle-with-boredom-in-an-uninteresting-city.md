This post resembles a rant more than an actual blog post; thus, I doubt that you
will gain anything from reading this. However, I feel like I must share these
thoughts in the hope of exorcising these sensations and, possibly, elicit a
solution.

I live in the periphery of a relatively small town. Therefore, the overall
landscape is not as vivid and full of life as it is in the bigger cities. While
this is somewhat of a blessing most of the time (e.g., less traffic, less
crowds, less overzealous businesses that raise their prices as it happens in
more touristy areas), it easily gets boring.

Perhaps my brain is just used to the constant stimulation provided by social
media, and perhaps my expectations are too high, as I am used to seeing a lot of
people going around in bigger cities with a ton of things to do and see.
However, I cannot help but feel bored when I am trying to spend some time here,
and I cannot help but feel so unmotivated to do anything that I often end up
doing nothing at all.

I genuinely _love_ photography. It is one of my passions,
alongside stationery and writing. So, one may ask, "Why don't you spend some
time practicing photography by going around in your city and shooting some
street or architectural photos?"

Well... This clashes with another issue of being in the same city in which you
were born and spent most of your life: you
take _everything_ for granted. And as much as one can tell
themselves "I must overcome this," it is always easier said than done, as it is
quite difficult to combat something subconscious on which you have little to no
control.

And this is the reason for this post: _I am bored_. As such, I turn
to something I like that allows me to deal with my boredom and helps in the
search for a solution, while also exorcising these bad
feelings: __writing_.

However, this blog post also serves another purpose: to justify a little bit of
additional exploration in the way this blog is organized. I would like to
leverage this platform to explore new interests, to try and see the same city
under a new light, and to explore new genres of photography---different from those
I am used to.

I hope that you, as a reader, will appreciate these new efforts that will
inevitably create new kinds of content. I also hope that you choose to chime in
by suggesting the ways _you_ deal with boredom and with an uninteresting and
uninspiring environment.

So... How do _you_ deal with boredom in an uninteresting
city?
