<h2 id="publications">Publications</h2>
<p>
     In this section, you'll find a list of my publications. I always try to provide a freely accessible version of all
     of my papers, to ensure that everyone can read them. Depending on the publisher, though, the ways I can do that may
     vary.

     For all those paper that ACM allows me to share through the
     <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/acm-author-izer-service" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Author-Izer</a>
     service, you'll find a little ACM DL logo
     <i class="ai ai-acmdl" aria-label="ACM Digital Library" title="Example of the icon to indicate free access to the paper"></i>
     that links to a full version of the paper.

     For all those paper published by Springer Nature that the publisher allows me to share through the <a
          href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/sharedit" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">SharedIt</a>
     service, you'll find a little Springer logo
     <i class="ai ai-springer" aria-label="Springer Nature SharedIt" title="Example of the icon to indicate free access to the paper"></i>
     that links to a full version of the paper.

     Similarly, if a paper is open access, you'll find an open access logo near the entry
     <i class="ai ai-open-access" aria-label="Open Access icon" title="Example of the icon to indicate open access"></i>.

     For all the papers that are neither open access nor available through other means, I always try to publish a
     pre-print version on
     <a href="https://arxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a>
     or
     <a href="https://www.researchgate.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResearchGate</a>,
     or a self-archived PDF version that is freely available (in compliance to the publisher's license). In those cases,
     pre-prints are marked using the arXiv logomark
     <i class="ai ai-arxiv" aria-label="Preprint available on arXiv"
          title="Example of the icon indicating that a preprint is available on arXiv"></i>
     or ResearchGate's icon
     <i class="fab fa-researchgate" title="Example of the icon indicating that a preprint is available on ResearchGate"
          aria-label="Example of the icon indicating that a preprint is available on ResearchGate"></i>
     (depending on the platform)
     while self-archived PDFs are marked with a PDF icon
     <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" title="Example of icon indicating a self-archived PDF version"
          aria-label="Example of icon indicating a self-archived PDF version"></i>.
