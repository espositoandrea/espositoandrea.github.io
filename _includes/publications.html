Part of my work is published in the ACM Digital Library. For all those paper
that ACM allows me to share through the
<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/acm-author-izer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Author-Izer</a>
service, you'll find a little ACM logo
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Association_for_Computing_Machinery_%28ACM%29_logo.svg" width=16 style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="ACM Digital Library" title="Example of the icon to indicate free access to the paper"/>
that links to a full version of the paper.
